Query: Add the first song from my music library to the playback queue and enable single song repeat mode
Planner: search for the user's music library
API Selector: GET /me/tracks
Caller: I need to make a GET request to retrieve a list of songs saved in the current Spotify user's "Your Music" library.
Operation: GET
Input: 
{
    "url": "https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/tracks",
    "params": {
        "market": "ES",
        "limit": 10,
        "offset": 0
    },
    "description": "The API response is a list of songs saved in the user's library.",
    "output_instructions": "What are the names and ids of the songs in the user's library?"
}
Code: 
# Extracting the names and ids of the songs in the user's library
songs = data['items']
song_names = [song['track']['name'] for song in songs]
song_ids = [song['track']['id'] for song in songs]

print("The names of the songs in the user's library are: {}".format(song_names))
print("The ids of the songs in the user's library are: {}".format(song_ids))
Parser: The names of the songs in the user's library are: []
The ids of the songs in the user's library are: []

Caller: Thought: I have successfully made the GET request to retrieve the list of songs in the user's library. However, the response does not contain any songs. I will need to retry the API call with different parameters to see if there are any songs in the library.

Plan: GET /me/tracks
Thought: I will retry the GET request to retrieve the list of songs in the user's library with different parameters.
Operation: GET
Input: 
{
    "url": "https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/tracks",
    "params": {
        "market": "ES",
        "limit": 50,
        "offset": 0
    },
    "description": "The API response is a list of songs saved in the user's library.",
    "output_instructions": "What are the names and ids of the songs in the user's library?"
}
Code: 
# Extracting the names and ids of the songs in the user's library
songs = data['items']
song_names = [song['track']['name'] for song in songs]
song_ids = [song['track']['id'] for song in songs]

print("The names of the songs in the user's library are: {}".format(song_names))
print("The ids of the songs in the user's library are: {}".format(song_ids))
Parser: The names of the songs in the user's library are: []
The ids of the songs in the user's library are: []

Caller: Thought: Thought: I have retried the GET request with different parameters, but the response still does not contain any songs. It seems that there are no songs saved in the user's library. I cannot complete the plan as there are no songs to retrieve.
