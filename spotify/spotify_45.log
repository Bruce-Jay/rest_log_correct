Query: Turn down the volume to 20
Planner: Set the volume to 20
API Selector: PUT /me/player/volume to set the volume to 20
Caller: I need to make a PUT request to set the volume of the user's current playback device to 20.

Operation: PUT
Input: 
{
    "url": "https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/player/volume",
    "params": {
        "volume_percent": 20
    },
    "description": "Set the volume for the user's current playback device.",
    "output_instructions": "No output instructions."
}
Parser: The API call to set the volume for the user's current playback device returned an error. The error message states that a premium subscription is required to use this player command.
Planner: Continue
API Selector: No API call needed. The volume cannot be set to 20 because a premium subscription is required to use this player command.
Planner: Final Answer: I'm sorry, but I am unable to turn down the volume to 20 as a premium subscription is required to use this player command.
