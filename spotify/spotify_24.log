API Selector: GET /me/top/artists to get the current user's top artists based on calculated affinity
Caller: To get the current user's top artists, I need to make a GET request to the /me/top/artists endpoint.
Operation: GET
Input: {
    "url": "https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/top/artists",
    "params": {
        "time_range": "medium_term",
        "limit": 20,
        "offset": 0
    },

print("The ids of the current user's top artists are: {}".format(artist_ids))
Parser: The names of the current user's top artists are: []
The ids of the current user's top artists are: []

Caller: Thought: The API call was successful, but the response does not contain any information about the current user's top artists. I need to check if there are any issues with the API call or if the current user does not have any top artists.

Background: The current user's username is 施政良.

Plan: GET /me/top/artists to get the current user's top artists based on calculated affinity

Thought: I will try to increase the limit parameter to see if it returns any results.
