# Extracting the names and ids of the songs in the user's library
songs = data['items']

print("The names of the songs in the user's library are: {}".format(song_names))
print("The ids of the songs in the user's library are: {}".format(song_ids))
Parser: The names of the songs in the user's library are: ['Cruel Summer', 'I Forgot That You Existed']
The ids of the songs in the user's library are: ['1BxfuPKGuaTgP7aM0Bbdwr', '43rA71bccXFGD4C8GOpIlN']
