Query: Append the first song of the newest album of my following first artist to my player queue
Planner: Search for the newest album of my following first artist
API Selector: GET /me/following
Caller: I need to make a GET request to retrieve the current user's followed artists.
Operation: GET
Input: 
{
    "url": "https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/following",
    "params": {
        "type": "artist"
    },
    "description": "Get the current user's followed artists.",
    "output_instructions": "No specific output instructions."
}
Code: 
# Filter the response to get the list of followed artists
followed_artists = data['artists']['items']

# Extract the name and id of each artist
artist_info = [(artist['name'], artist['id']) for artist in followed_artists]

# Print the result
print("The followed artists are: {}".format(artist_info))
Parser: The followed artists are: []

Planner: Final Answer: I'm sorry, but you are not following any artists. Please follow an artist first before appending their newest album to your player queue.
