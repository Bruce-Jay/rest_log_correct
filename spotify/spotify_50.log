Query: Play the third song from my music library and set the single track repeat mode
Planner: search for my music library
API Selector: GET /me/tracks
Caller: I need to make a GET request to retrieve a list of songs saved in the current Spotify user's "Your Music" library.
Operation: GET
Input: 
{
    "url": "https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/tracks",
    "params": {
        "market": "ES",
        "limit": 10,
        "offset": 0
    },
    "description": "The API response is a list of songs saved in the user's library.",
    "output_instructions": "What are the names and ids of the songs in the user's library?"
}
Code: 
songs = data['items']
song_names = [song['track']['name'] for song in songs]
song_ids = [song['track']['id'] for song in songs]

print("The names of the songs in the user's library are: {}".format(song_names))
print("The ids of the songs in the user's library are: {}".format(song_ids))
Parser: The names of the songs in the user's library are: []
The ids of the songs in the user's library are: []

Caller: Thought: The API call was successful, but the response does not contain any songs in the user's library. I need to retry the API call with different parameters to see if there are any songs available.

Plan: GET /me/tracks
Thought: I will retry the API call with a different limit and offset to retrieve more songs from the user's library.
Operation: GET
Input: 
{
    "url": "https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/tracks",
    "params": {
        "market": "ES",
        "limit": 50,
        "offset": 0
    },
    "description": "The API response is a list of songs saved in the user's library.",
    "output_instructions": "What are the names and ids of the songs in the user's library?"
}
Code: 
# Extracting the names and ids of the songs in the user's library
songs = data['items']
song_names = [song['track']['name'] for song in songs]
song_ids = [song['track']['id'] for song in songs]

print("The names of the songs in the user's library are: {}".format(song_names))
print("The ids of the songs in the user's library are: {}".format(song_ids))
Parser: The names of the songs in the user's library are: []
The ids of the songs in the user's library are: []

Caller: Thought: Thought: The API call was successful, but the response still does not contain any songs in the user's library. It seems that the user does not have any songs saved in their library. I cannot complete the plan as there are no songs to retrieve.


=============
Ground truth: ['GET /me/tracks', 'GET /tracks/{id}', 'PUT /me/player/play', 'PUT /me/player/repeat']
