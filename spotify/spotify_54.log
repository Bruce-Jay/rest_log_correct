Query: Add album Mojito to my music library
Planner: search album with name "Mojito"
API Selector: GET /search?q=Mojito&type=album
Caller: I need to make a GET request to search for albums with the keyword "Mojito".
Operation: GET
Input: 
{
    "url": "https://api.spotify.com/v1/search",
    "params": {
        "q": "Mojito",
        "type": "album"
    },
    "description": "Get Spotify catalog information about albums that match the keyword 'Mojito'.",
    "output_instructions": "What are the names and ids of the albums that match the keyword 'Mojito'?"
}
Code: 
albums = data['albums']['items']
album_names = [album['name'] for album in albums]
album_ids = [album['id'] for album in albums]

print("The names of the albums that match the keyword 'Mojito' are: {}".format(album_names))
print("The ids of the albums that match the keyword 'Mojito' are: {}".format(album_ids))
Output too long, truncating to 500 tokens
Parser: The names of the albums that match the keyword 'Mojito' are: ['Mojito', 'Mojito', 'Mojito', 'Mojito', 'Mojito', 'Mojito', 'Mojito', 'Mojito', 'Mojito', 'Mojito', 'Mojito', 'Mojito', 'Mojito', 'Mojito', 'Mojito', 'Mojito', 'Mojito (III: De Cuba y Veracruz)', 'Mojito (Foreign Barmaid)', 'MOJITO', 'Mojito F.C.']
The ids of the albums that match the keyword 'Mojito' are: ['3YgAlfZsB8TBpUxh0mwoJj', '1Jn5rznEEW8wyVt2emzwWt', '1okSmL1Ki4dge0VIS7A9Xv', '6fr9aa3w1UjDUQfDPyW8ya', '1ZwcPxRq5bjvCshnpZVSH8', '7GzQH3UuUVUZNTB
Planner: Add album 'Mojito' (id 3YgAlfZsB8TBpUxh0mwoJj) to my music library
API Selector: PUT /me/albums to add album 'Mojito' (id 3YgAlfZsB8TBpUxh0mwoJj) to my music library
Caller: I need to execute the PUT /me/albums API call to add the album 'Mojito' to my music library. I already have the album id, which is 3YgAlfZsB8TBpUxh0mwoJj.

Operation: PUT
Input: {
    "url": "https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/albums",
    "params": {
        "ids": "3YgAlfZsB8TBpUxh0mwoJj"
    },
    "description": "Save the album 'Mojito' to my music library.",
    "output_instructions": "No output instructions."
}

Thought: I will now execute the PUT /me/albums API call to add the album 'Mojito' to my music library.

Operation: PUT
Input: {
    "url": "https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/albums",
    "params": {
